                <p class="aboutMe-paragraph">My Name is Maria Azam. I was born in Fredricton, New Brunswick, and grew up predominantly in Brampton (a suburb outside of Toronto). I grew up in the early 2000s, a time when very few people could use a computer, let alone understood how it works. Luckily for me, I recieved early exposure of the the developement end of web design from my father. From a young age, I used my extremely limited knowledge to make webpages about everything I could think of. I'm excited to go back to my roots and see what I could accomplish as a professional web developer. </p>
                <p class="aboutMe-paragraph">Currently, I am an aspiring web developer. I tutor highschool students in math, chemistry and, physics tutor.  I'm also a barista on the side. </p>
